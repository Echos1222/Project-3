12/10/25 11:13 AM- This project involves creating and managing index files that will contain a b-tree.  There will be 6 commands that are involved with the index file. The index will be disk-based and has specific specifications for headers and nodes. The first thing I will do is figure out the basic file strucutre for the index file and for now I plan on having four classes but might add more. Right now I plan to have a indexFile, header, node, and the driver class. Will work on the file format and then create a file.

12/10/25 2:35 - Created the index driver file that takes in a command and successfully created the index file class with the specifications. Have not made the b tree but have set up the calls to that class for the operations in the index file. Also added the header class that is used to create the index file. Will work on reading and writing nodes and implementing insert. Will split it up into three clases for nodes and one B tree class.

12/10/25 6:31 - Created my BTree node class with all the specifications of block size 512 , max keys of 19 and 20 since minimal degree is 10. Had some issues with the disk node class where in memory I was incrementing correctly but I was not writing it back to disk which was causing blocks to be overwritten after a restart. Created a NODEIO class that allows for the B-tree to be stored in disk and defines how the B-tree accesses nodes. Created A DiskNodeIO class that implements the functions with the specifications that were defined in node io so reading writing and allocating.

12/10/25 7:19 - Finished the encoding decoding of nodes which I called NodeSerializer to enforce that nodes must be stored in 512 bytes. Next I will work on actually implementing the B-tree algorithm and testing out the entire program to make sure it works
