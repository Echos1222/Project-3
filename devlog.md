12/10/25 11:13 AM- This project involves creating and managing index files that will contain a b-tree.  There will be 6 commands that are involved with the index file. The index will be disk-based and has specific specifications for headers and nodes. The first thing I will do is figure out the basic file strucutre for the index file and for now I plan on having four classes but might add more. Right now I plan to have a indexFile, header, node, and the driver class. Will work on the file format and then create a file.

12/10/25 2:35 - Created the index driver file that takes in a command and successfully created the index file class with the specifications. Have not made the b tree but have set up the calls to that class for the operations in the index file. Also added the header class that is used to create the index file. Will work on reading and writing nodes and implementing insert. Will split it up into three clases for nodes and one B tree class.
