12/10/25 11:13 AM- This project involves creating and managing index files that will contain a b-tree.  There will be 6 commands that are involved with the index file. The index will be disk-based and has specific specifications for headers and nodes. The first thing I will do is figure out the basic file strucutre for the index file and for now I plan on having four classes but might add more. Right now I plan to have a indexFile, header, node, and the driver class. Will work on the file format and then create a file.
